Utilizing Django, Python & Postgresql, our team built a online classroom application. Teachers will be able to login to create a new class with assignment for students to complete. Students will receive a grade based on the correctness of their responses. 

- Teachers can create a class for students and post assignments
- Students enroll in classes and complete assignments
- Teachers will grade assignments and share back with students
