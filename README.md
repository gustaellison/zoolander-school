#### **_Description_**

Utilizing Django, Python & Postgresql, our team built a Learning Management System (LMS) and aimed to improve efficiency and user interface versus other LMS implementations. Many different features are incorporated within, and allows the user to identify themselves as either a teacher or student role. Here are some examples:

Teachers:
- Can create assignments and assign student users to them
- Can recieve back work to be graded and return the grade to students
- Make a teacher profile on classroom page
- View lists of students enrolled in a course
- And much more!

Students: 
- Can enroll in various classes or be enrolled by a teacher
- View their respective grades on assignments
- View a list of their assigned classes 
- Can view what work is due soon
- Can view details of a class including a schedule, teacher, students list, etc.
